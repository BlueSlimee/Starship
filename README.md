# Starship
## Discord OAuth made easy
Starship was build to make Discord OAuth the easiest possible yet safe. Using JWT, all the communication between the client and the server is pretty safe.
And, you can switch from passport-discord without having to do major changes to your server-side code. The biggest changes will be in your front-end code.

## How to use Starship?
Exemples for server-side are located under `tests/` directory.
I will create front-end examples pretty soon, pls wait
